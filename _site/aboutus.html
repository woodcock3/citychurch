<h1>What’s the church like?</h1>
<p>We are a multi-cultural mutli-generational church family gathering from all around Leeds. We are built upon the Word of God and seek to proclaim the wonderful good news of Jesus Christ in Beeston and Leeds. We desire to see people come to know God through Jesus Christ and to begin the lifelong journey of being transformed into the likeness of Jesus.</p>

<h1>Our aim</h1>
<p>Colossian 1 verse 28 (in the bible) summarises our aim:</p>

<p>‘Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ.’</p>

<p>Or in the words of Jesus, ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all nations.’</p>

<p>Realising our need of the Lord and our need of his spirit to be at work amongst us we seek to have a atmosphere of prayer in all that we do.</p>

<h1>What we believe</h1>
<p>Our full statement of faith can be found on our belieifs page. This outlines what we believe about God, the bible and Jesus. Our beliefs are in line with the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC) statement of beliefs.</p>
